Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository serves as a showcase of my work and provides insight into my previous work history as a web developer. Here, you'll find a compilation of both my past work history and select examples of my recent projects. It provides an overview of my skills, experience, and expertise as a web developer.

## **Contents:**  
- **Work History:** Explore my previous roles, responsibilities, and accomplishments in the field of web development.  
- **Project Showcase:** View a curated selection of projects that highlight my capabilities and design sensibilities.  

Feel free to browse through the contents to gain insights into my journey as a developer and the quality of work I deliver.

*This project was already finished before I made the Github repository.  I have not used Github much in the past because I have always worked by myself. However, I will be adding projects in the future to display that I do in fact know how to properly use git.
